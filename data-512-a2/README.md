# A2: Bias in Data

The goal of this assignment is to identify potential sources of bias in the Wikipedia Talk corpus of data annotated by annotators from Crowdworkers, and describe some implications of those biases.

## Data Source

The data for the analysis has been collected from [Figshare](https://figshare.com/projects/Wikipedia_Talk/16731)
The analysis focuses on two datasets- [Toxicity](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Wikipedia_Talk_Labels_Toxicity/4563973) and [Personal Attacks](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Wikipedia_Talk_Labels_Personal_Attacks/4054689)
